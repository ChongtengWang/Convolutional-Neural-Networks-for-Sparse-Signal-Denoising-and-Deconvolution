# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sparse Signal Denoising and Deconvolution -- Master Thesis

This is the repository for Master thesis in 2022 advised by [Professor Ivan Selesnick](https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

This repository intends to save the programs to reproduce the results in the thesis.
There are four main Matlab program files and several Matlab function files as well as .mat files which are necessary to run the main programs.
Two demos for the denoising and deconvolution tasks are included in the program files.
Other two programs are to metric and show the performance of the denoising and deconvolution CNNs.

## Contents

1. [Demo for denoising task](/denoiser/demo_denoiser.m)
2. [Demo for deconvolution task](/denoiser/figures.m)
3. [Performance metric for the denoising CNN](/deconvolver/demo_deconvolver.m)
4. [Performance metric for the deconvolution CNN](/deconvolver/figures.m)

## Experimental settings

All the software needed to run the demo and performance programs is [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html?s_tid=gn_getml). 

In the thesis, all the experiments were implemented using MATLAB (version 9.9) on a MacBook Pro (Apple M1 Pro).

## List of Matlab program files available in this repository

Following is the list of demos available in this repository. When you run the main programs, you need to download the necessary function files as well as the .m files into the same directory where the main programs are. The figures which show performance of the CNNs will be saved as eps file in the 'figures' directory.
