# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sparse Signal Denoising and Deconvolution -- Master Thesis

This is the repository for Master thesis in 2022 advised by Professor Ivan Selesnick at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

This repository intends to save the programs to reproduce the results in the thesis.
There are four main Matlab program files and several function files as well as .mat files which are necessary to run the main programs.
Two demos for the denoising and deconvolution tasks are included in the program files.
Other two programs are to metric and show the performance of the denoising and deconvolution CNNs.
